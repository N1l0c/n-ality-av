# N-ality Audio Visual Scaffold

A web-based audiovisual synthesizer exploring the generalization of duality through frequency, color, and gesture. Built with React, Tone.js, and HTML5 Canvas, this project visualizes the emergent patterns of multiple interacting sine waves modulated by user input.

## 🎯 Concept

### N-ality

This is not an instrument of binary oppositions — it's a space for exploring multiplicity: the *n-ality* of rhythm, harmony, pitch, and interference. Inspired by polyrhythms, beat frequencies, and the emergent qualities of simple oscillations interacting in complex ways.

### Philosophy Meets Modulation

- **Emergence from minimal means**: Identical sine waves slowly modulated to produce perceptual complexity.
- **Visualized interference**: Beat patterns render in real time, color-coded by pitch space.
- **Perceptual coherence**: Color-sound mappings hint at synaesthesia — to be refined with input from real synaesthetes.
- **Jazz logic**: Structure as negotiation in time, not imposition — modulation as improvisation.

### Influence & Inspiration

- David Lynch’s meditative fishing: we’re waiting for deep forms to surface.
- Ivan Illich’s convivial tools: interfaces that empower, not dominate.
- James Bridle’s new dark age: speculative, luminous, and post-digital.
- Michael Levin’s generative biology: pattern, memory, and modulation.

## 🧠 Philosophy & Aesthetics

This is not just a synthesizer. It’s a way of making sense through **motion, modulation, and multiplicity**. It's a musical score for the three-body problem. A glowing interface where structure arises from touch, not code. Where waves become form, and interference is a method of meaning.

The three-body problem is not solvable in closed form, but it is interpretable through pattern, resonance, and rhythm — much like a good improvisation.
