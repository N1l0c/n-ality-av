# N-ality Audio Visual Scaffold

A web-based audiovisual synthesizer exploring the generalization of duality through frequency, color, and gesture. Built with React, Tone.js, and HTML5 Canvas, this project visualizes the emergent patterns of multiple interacting sine waves modulated by user input — now extended with live microphone input, feedback loops, and glowing attractor dynamics.

## 🎯 Concept

### N-ality

This is not an instrument of binary oppositions — it's a space for exploring multiplicity: the *n*-ality of rhythm, harmony, pitch, and interference. Inspired by polyrhythms, beat frequencies, and the emergent qualities of simple oscillations interacting in complex ways.

### From Feedback to Form

- **Feedback as Attractor**: Live mic input creates feedback loops with the oscillators, surfacing dynamic interference patterns.
- **Co-creative Ecosystem**: Future iterations will let multiple users contribute — imagine a musical version of *Spore*.
- **Embodied Interface**: Mic input enables gestural interaction, where breath and voice shape the landscape.
- **Pattern Recognition as Sensemaking**: Like MassSense (see Dave Snowden and The Cynefin Centre's work) for the senses — emergent structures in the visual field act as perceptual anchors.

### Philosophy Meets Modulation

- Emergence from minimal means: Identical sine waves slowly modulated to produce perceptual complexity.
- Visualized interference: Beat patterns render in real time, color-coded by pitch space.
- Perceptual coherence: Color-sound mappings hint at synaesthesia — to be refined with input from real synaesthetes.
- Jazz logic: Structure as negotiation in time, not imposition — modulation as improvisation.

## 🌟 Influence & Inspiration

- David Lynch’s meditative fishing: we’re waiting for deep forms to surface.
- Ivan Illich’s convivial tools: interfaces that empower, not dominate.
- James Bridle’s new dark age: speculative, luminous, and post-digital.
- Michael Levin’s generative biology: pattern, memory, and modulation.
- Dave Snowden’s Cynefin and MassSense: collective meaning from distributed signal.

## 🧠 Philosophy & Aesthetics

This is not just a synthesizer. It’s a space for sonic becoming — a co-creative environment where breath, motion, and modulation converge. A musical score for the three-body problem. A glowing interface where structure arises from touch, not code. Where waves become form, and interference is a method of meaning.

The three-body problem is not solvable in closed form, but it is interpretable through pattern, resonance, and rhythm — much like a good improvisation.
